Thanks for visiting my site! My name is James Denton, and this is my first attempt at a weblog about various topics focused around OpenStack and various network technologies.

## Personal 

I live with my wife, Amanda, and our two children in the San Antonio, Texas area. We've got two dogs who are are often more work to maintain than the kids. Love 'em, though.  

## Professional 

I’ve been in the Information Technology field for nearly 15 years, starting out with desktop support for a small school district in South Texas. In that job, I cut my teeth on Novell Netware 3.x and DOS, gradually working my way up to the Network Administrator role and administerting Netware, Linux, and Windows systems along with it. For the last eight years I've been employed at Rackspace Hosting in San Antonio, Texas, and am currently a Principal Architect focused on cloud networking and support for the Rackspace Private Cloud product based on OpenStack.

In my spare time, I managed to crank out a few books on OpenStack networking:

- _Learning OpenStack Networking_, published in late 2014 (ISBN 978-1783983308)
- _Learning OpenStack Networking, Second Edition_, published in late 2015 (ISBN 978-1785287725)
- _OpenStack Networking Essentials_, published in early 2016 (ISBN 978-1785283277)
  
All three of these books are available from Amazon.com and other major booksellers.
