## Personal 

I'm a military spouse living with my wife, Amanda, and our three children in the Dayton, Ohio area. I've recently taken up electronics repair as a hobby, specifically vintage personal computing equipment of the Apple Lisa and Macintosh variety. 

## Professional 

Iâ€™ve been in the Information Technology field for over 15 years, cutting my teeth on Novell Netware 3.x and DOS/Windows 95/98/2000 and later administering Novell Netware 6+, AIX, Linux, and Windows server systems. For the last nine years I've been employed at Rackspace Hosting in San Antonio, Texas, and am currently a Principal Architect focused on cloud networking and support for the Rackspace Private Cloud product based on OpenStack.

In my spare time, I've managed to write or be involved with a few books on OpenStack-related topics, including:

- _Learning OpenStack Networking_, published in late 2014 ([ISBN 978-1783983308](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-OpenStack-Networking-Neutron-Denton/dp/1783983302/))
- _Learning OpenStack Networking, Second Edition_, published in late 2015 ([ISBN 978-1785287725](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-OpenStack-Networking-Neutron-Second/dp/1785287729/))
- _OpenStack Networking Essentials_, published in early 2016 ([ISBN 978-1785283277](https://www.amazon.com/OpenStack-Networking-Essentials-James-Denton/dp/1785283278/))
- _OpenStack Cloud Computing Cookbook, Fourth Edition_, published in early 2018 ([ISBN 978-1788398763](https://www.amazon.com/OpenStack-Cloud-Computing-Cookbook-networking/dp/1788398769/))
- _Learning OpenStack Networking, Third Edition_, in progress, to be published in mid 2018

All four books are available from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/-/e/B00NUS5RTS) and other major booksellers.
