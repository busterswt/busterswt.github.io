Thanks for visiting my site! My name is James Denton, and this is my first attempt at a weblog about various topics focused around OpenStack and various network technologies or general tech stuff.

## Personal 

I'm a military spouse living with my wife, Amanda, and our two children in the Dayton, Ohio area. In my spare time I enjoy repairing broken things, not completing DIY home projects, and have spent too much time recently waxing nostalgic for old Apple Lisa and Macintosh computers and outdated networking technologies.

## Professional 

Iâ€™ve been in the Information Technology field for over 15 years, starting out as a desktop support technician for a small school district in South Texas. In that job, I cut my teeth on Novell Netware 3.x and DOS/Windows 95/98/2000/XP. Over an eight year span I became the Network Administrator and administered Netware, AIX, Linux, and Windows systems along with anything else technology-related. For the last nine years I've been employed at Rackspace Hosting in San Antonio, Texas, and am currently a Principal Architect focused on cloud networking and support for the Rackspace Private Cloud product based on OpenStack.

In my spare time, I've managed to write or be involved with a few books on OpenStack-related topics, including:

- _Learning OpenStack Networking_, published in late 2014 (ISBN 978-1783983308)
- _Learning OpenStack Networking, Second Edition_, published in late 2015 (ISBN 978-1785287725)
- _OpenStack Networking Essentials_, published in early 2016 (ISBN 978-1785283277)
- _OpenStack Cloud Computing Cookbook, Fourth Edition_, published in late 2017/early 2018 (ISBN 978-1788398763)
- _Learning OpenStack Networking, Third Edition_, in progress, to be published in mid 2018

All four books are available from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/-/e/B00NUS5RTS) and other major booksellers.
